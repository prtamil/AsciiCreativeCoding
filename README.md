```

257 programs. Pure C. Zero GUI dependencies. MTGA — Make Terminal Great Again.

All simulations share a unified architecture and fixed-timestep physics loop.
Each program can be studied independently or as part of the full simulation framework.

## What This Is

A collection of real-time interactive simulations built entirely in C with ncurses. Every program runs in a terminal window — no OpenGL, no SDL, no graphics library. The constraint is the point: forcing complex physics and rendering through a character grid sharpens the understanding of every algorithm involved.

Topics span from elementary cellular automata to the Navier-Stokes equations. From Conway's Game of Life to a Crank-Nicolson Schrödinger solver. From a Bresenham wireframe renderer to a full SDF raymarcher with Blinn-Phong shading.

**Build requirement:** `gcc`, `ncurses`, `libm`. That's it.

For per-program algorithm notes, see [DEMOS.md](DEMOS.md).

## Design Choices

> *"All art is quite useless."*
> — Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray

This project is not a library. It is not a framework. It is not a toolkit.
It is closer to a sketchbook — 257 individual programs, each complete in itself,
each existing for no reason other than that it is interesting to build and beautiful to watch.

**Every file is self-contained by intention.**
There are no shared headers, no common modules, no inter-file dependencies. Code
duplication is a deliberate trade-off: a repeated 20-line physics loop in every
file is far better than a shared abstraction that requires understanding six other
files before you can touch one. When a simulation changes, only one file changes.
No edge cases bleed across boundaries. No ripple effects. You can delete any file
and nothing else breaks.

**Copying is the intended usage.**
To run any simulation, copy the file, compile, and run:
```bash
gcc filename.c -lncurses -lm && ./a.out
```
That is the entire workflow. No build system, no CMake, no Makefile, no package
manager, no project configuration. A single file is a single program. A learner
can take any file, read it top to bottom, and understand the whole thing.

**Linux terminal only. No Windows, no GUI.**
Every simulation targets a POSIX terminal with ncurses. The constraint is the
medium: forcing a Navier-Stokes solver or a path tracer through a character grid
demands a much sharper understanding of the underlying math than reaching for a
graphics API would. The terminal is not a limitation — it is the whole point.

**Art for art's sake.**
None of these simulations solve a practical problem. A falling-sand automaton has
no business case. A Buddhabrot renderer does not ship a product. A mushroom-cloud
raymarcher is not on anyone's roadmap. That uselessness is precisely what makes
them worth building. The best way to understand an algorithm is to make it
beautiful with no deadline and no stakeholder.

**One physics model, one rendering model, applied uniformly.**
Every file uses the same fixed-timestep accumulator, the same pixel-space
coordinate model, and the same ncurses double-buffer sequence. A reader who
studies one file can read any other. The framework is not hidden — it is the
first thing documented in every source file.

## Architecture

Every simulation uses the same framework:

```
§1 config   — all constants in one place
§2 clock    — CLOCK_MONOTONIC nanosecond timer
§3 color    — 256-color with 8-color fallback
§4 physics  — simulation state, fixed-timestep step()
§5 draw     — scene_draw() via ncurses primitives
§6 app      — main loop: input → physics → render → sleep
```

Physics runs in **pixel space** (`CELL_W=8 px`, `CELL_H=16 px` per terminal cell), independent of terminal size. The only coordinate conversion is inside `scene_draw()`.

Frame sequence: `erase() → draw → wnoutrefresh() → doupdate()`. The `typeahead(-1)` call prevents tearing. No custom double-buffer — ncurses provides it.

## Documentation

`documentation/learning/` contains a `concept_*.md` file for every program in the project. Each file has two passes:

- **Pass 1** — core idea, mental model, key equations, data structures, non-obvious design decisions, open questions to explore
- **Pass 2** — pseudocode, module map, data flow diagram, core loop

`documentation/Master.md` is the cross-cutting reference: each technique used in the project is explained from first principles, names the source files where it appears, and (for named algorithms) cites the canonical paper, textbook, or author.

---

## Dependencies

- `gcc` (C11)
- `libncurses` (`sudo apt install libncurses5-dev` or equivalent)
- `libm` (standard, always available)

Nothing else. No CMake, no package manager, no runtime dependencies.
